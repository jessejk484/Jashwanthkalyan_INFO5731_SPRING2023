1,going to watch future best animated picture winner minionsrise of gru had high hopes was not however expected the experience that had the story was crisp and emotional the animations though fake felt realer than eversay this with no exaggerationit was better than morbius its morbin timemore like its minion time
2,minions the rise of gru follows 11 34 year old gru voiced by steve carrell trying to make a name for himself and join the ranks of an elite villians group the vicious 6 with humble beginnings as a troublemaker in his mothers basement the minions voiced by pierre coffin are determined to help him succeed in his missionthe film is a sort of origin story for gru despite having elusions to his childhood in the 1st and 3rd movies the wacky and wonderful minions carry the film but sadly the plot seems haphazard the henchmen jeanclawed voice by jeanclaude van damme svengeance voiced by dolph lundgren and stronghold voiced by danny trejo all seem to be secondstring compared to belle bottom voiced by tarajp henson and wild knuckles voiced by alan arkin the animation is fairly standard of the earlier movies the flow is solid and the films ending kind of makes sense but the plot in general is a bit of a hodgepodgeworth a watch with the kids
3,im not sure why this movie doesnt have a higher rating because found it really enjoyable and much better than the first outinglets start with the few negatives have to say because there arent many first the head female villain is a little annoying also there could do with a little bit more emotion so we appreciate the humour even more these things are nitpicky though as for the most part this is great funlets now take it for what it is a comedy animation aimed mostly at kids so is it animated well yes its one of the clearest most colourful animations think have ever seen is it funny yes in fact its very funny laughed many times throughout proving you dont have to eve use proper words to be funny mr bean is a prime example of that and so here are the minions lastly will kids get bored absolutely not the story although with limited payout moves along at such a great pace the movie felt really short and the minions are so consistently funny kids will never get tired of it and actually neither will the big kids adultsfinally still maintain there is nothing cuter in this world than bob and when he does his pleading face is like a puppy x100a last though is that if they want to keep this franchise alive though think they need to move onto shorts because that will it will stop it becoming too repetitive and boring
4,its a fun movie minion scenes are more than gru and thankfully so the chemistry between minions characters is epic love kevin bob and stuartthere is no deep meaning or higher message a simple carefree movie which is supposed to be seen that way
5,this movie has so many references to the sixties and seventies that dont think people under twenty will understand the puns innuendos and jokes the children in the theater will still laugh at the slapstick jokes
6,in his world gru is the most powerful villain anyone has ever seen but the question is how did he become this dominant force minions the rise of gru shows us the exciting story of 12year old gru and the path to his villainous life both the familiar faces and the new characters come together to make this make this film highly entertaining yet nostalgicminions the rise of gru provides the backstory for how gru steve carell came to be the notorious villain he is today after being rejected as a replacement for wild knuckles alan arkin and failing to earn a muchcoveted spot in the supervillain group vicious 6 gru unexpectedly finds himself on the run as fate would have it grus dream of being mentored by wild knuckles soon comes true but not without gru having to now lean on wild knuckles and his minions to fight back against the vicious 6the three main minionskevin stuart and bobeach have unique character traits that make these films work in minions the rise of gru you can see how each minion plays a different role in how gru grows as a villain and as a person kevin is the smart and responsible leaderhe makes sure everything is going according to plan stuart is the one who is always in touch with reality and makes sure the truth is knownhe may seem uninterested but hes very helpful bob is the lighthearted and innocent soul who always tries to make the best out of a situation without all three of these characters this movie wouldnt be the same there are many subtle references to the previous movies that add to the comedic tone as well for instance in the scene where gru and wild knuckles attempt to rob the bank the bank president shows them an image of his grandson who turns out to be none other than the aspiring villain vector of course young gru isnt aware that vector will play a big role in his future but the audience definitely is these subtle references are what contribute to the nostalgic feel we get from watching this film and of course we cant forget about grus iconic wardrobe which hes already wearing as a young kidthe message of minions the rise of gru is that everyone needs a little help sometimes even though he doesnt realize it right away gru eventually recognizes that he needs help in order to be the successful villain he desires to beminions the rise of gru is such a fun movie to watch the lovable characters just make the audience continue to yearn for more give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12 though anyone can enjoy this movie minions the rise of gru releases in theaters on july 1 2022 make sure you check it out by maica n kids first
7,it may feel in total like this franchise is running out of steam or at least fresh and creative ideas but minions the rise of gru does manage to be decently entertaining and charming enough to be worth at least a one time watch a lot of people critics included bash the 2015 film minions for a lack of a true plot among many other things but in my personal opinion actually enjoyed the first minions movie and may even find it better than this one although both films are flawed minions had a very clear although frantic vision set in mind for ts characters and never felt like a combination of two completely different films like this one did so what is it about this film that makes it worth watching well the animation for one is absolutely fantastic gorgeous visuals that are easily the best to ever come out of illumination in their companys entire run kid gru is also a fun and charming lead and ill be darned if the minions silly gags didnt charm me from time to time and even earn a chuckle or two the airplane scene most of all its plot is truly all over the place much like the first film and its focus on characters feels very divided as well as its focus on future characters come to be in the franchise considering and reminding the audience how this is a prequel in case the 70s vibes wouldnt tell you otherwise dont know its entertaining it has its moments and found some fun in it its an uneven little flick but its use of colorful visuals and fun characters make it decent enough for a pleasant experience and certainly trumps the third despicable me film and latest franchise release before this one almost 5 years ago its hard to believe this franchise is still going and how it still manages to propel itself forward but in this age of commercialization and franchises minions the rise of gru can be more tolerable than mostmy rating 6210
8,the latest from illumination studios is another adventure actually a prequel this time as we follow how gru still voiced by steve carrell tries to get in the door to join the vicious six voiced by alan arkin tarajp henson jean claude van damme lucy lawless danny trejo amp dolph lundrgren after they have betrayed arkin during a sacred stone heist dismissing him as being too young amp distracted by another potential tryout gru manages to steal the stone sending the baddies on his tail but due to one of the accompanying minions trading the stone out for a pet rock the race is on to get the rock back before the vicious six really five at this point get their collective mitts on it sure the film is threadbare plotwise being an excuse to have a bunch of minion antics running throughout the story like socks on a laundry line but the film is nothing but fun amp unlike the shrek films which acted as an alternative to the pixar output at least the illumination team keeps pushing the envelope on perfecting their visuals standouts include the textures on the minions goggles amp grus realistic expressions when hes upset or challenged returning champs to the franchise include julie andrews as grus mom russell brand as mr nefario hes not a doc yet wmichelle yeoh as a kung fu master the minions get lessons from amp the rza as a biker who gives a minion a much needed ride to san francisco
9,the reason the rise of gru feels like such a let down is because it lacks creativity theres not enough of minions but theres not enough of the young gru either thats not to say it isnt a movie families with young children will have fun watching but compared to this movies predecessor and all the despicable me movies so far the rise of gru is probably the flattest of each of themdirected by kyle balda from a story written and cothought by matthew fogel this minions movie brings back steve carrell to voice the childversion of the superbadsuperdad gru and pierre coffin as the minions to a setting during the 1970s and behind the despicable me movies if you are a despicable me fan or just appreciate the original movies this film offers a delightful set of hilarious references and other jokes thatll have the whole family laughing the typical requirements for animated movies such as voices animation and other things all work out well in this moviehowever for a despicable me prequel titled minions the rise of gru this film sure lacks a fair amount of time to laugh with the minions and the child gru doesnt have enough of a story or motive behind him that keeps us fully appealed to the story this film also follows the predictable despicable me basis of having protagonists working with their own lives but then theres the threat by the villains and this movies group of villains may be funny but theyre completely unoriginal leading to the plot to be quite blandif you liked this review check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews
10,just loved it the whole time there is no time to get bored at all its full of wellmade action and really funny stuff and the minions are truly lovely
11,join gru and the minions in the sequel thats actually better than the first its fun for kids teens adults and seniors lets make this film gross 1 trillion in the freaking box office yall
12,minion the rise of gruwhat a disappointment this was and quite frankly was bored from start to finishyet again the script writers have failed to glean from the original movie what was the magical element that made this franchise a success clearly is was the strength of story brilliant and inventive animation and well drawn and memorable characters here the story was tissue thin grus family was all but missing there was little reason for things to happen and the animation was largely uninventive with just repetition from earlier movieswhat was key in the original movie what the strong relationship ties between the characters at best they were casual acquaintances in this movienobody liked it except the children who seem mesmerised by the minions clearly easily pleasedfor me this is a 5 outta 10 barely a screensaver
13,all trolling aside this movie was very average and below average as far as kids movies go the animation is top notch but at this point the minions pretty much have the same jokes in every movie you know what to expect here theres nothing new kids will love it and parents will probably still hate it although it might bring out a couple chuckles with some sly adult jokes the animation carries this film
14,this is by far the best movie of the year id say it even competes with the godfather its that amazing the cinematography the dialogue with the minions and gru its fantastic this movie is an emotional roller coaster with genius directing this is a must watch movie for all generations and highly recommend
15,if you have kids and want to be like a kid go see this movie better yet take a matinee show where you will be with other kidsthis movie has everythingfrom start to end loved the movieand yes my kids loved it toomake sure to take popcorn with youwhat do you want to be when you grow upwant to be a super villain
16,likesthe references if youve read my reviews before youll know im a sucker for easter eggs and references to other genres of hollywood the second installment of minions was a delight in this avenue loaded with nods to various movies and their scenes that made them famous from the opening scene where we revisit indiana jones temple run to the kung fu movies that made the 60s80s so much fun its these references that a movie goer like me enjoys its enjoyable to see the dynamics unfold and loved taking a trip back into this twisted memory of videos watched as a kid found this to be a part adults will like and a way to open up to other audiences past the target agethe voice acting part of the fun of animated features is the voice actors who make the cartons and cgmodels come to life and add that emotion minions rise of gru is loaded with talent pulling a wide variety of voices that leads to fun characters and new voices for your little ones to impersonate the vicious 6 the collective bunch of baddies has stellar talent in the form of those iconic actors that seem to be background voices like dolph lundgren danny trejo and lucy lawless are just some of the voices that you will hear and though not the most prominent they still have a great place in this film others like tarajp henson and michelle yeoh have bigger roles and get that sass factor you love in the characters of this goofy world and there are other characters reviving their parts like russell brand and julie andrews who though short and sweet do it so well yet the main voices are the top billed cast and they work the real charm in this movie arkin as white knuckle is pretty much playing his live action roles in an animated form and it works as the jokes threats and warming moments feel genuine and caustic like the old age jokes he often is the butt of pierre coffin is still the energetic and hyper voice of the various yellow blobs that are the minions though they sound very much the same coffin manages to really work personalities into the four main guys to stand out and work with the physical personas that they wear so well its a subtle thing for audience members like me but appreciate the effort to make them stand out a bit more as for carrell he rocks the gru voice he invented so well but this time changes the pitch to sound like a kid version of gru we saw in the original and yet this time more charm and emotion were seen and it worked very well to craft more of the evil villains formative years to explain so much all in all the acting is stacked and well executed and quite enjoyed how well they played togetherthe pace its a kids movie so you can expect that the movie is going to be very quick paced and not standing still too much however rise of gru manages to still harness that speed and tone it down to give you those moments that allow for character development and training without blowing it over completely true the movie does not quite have the balance or natural layout of despicable me but for a sequel of a prequel the balance is quite welcome and perfectly fit for the other components put into the moviethe music the gru legacy is chock full of music from the various decades that fans dive into no matter what age you currently are in this prequel  the trend continues with some orchestra work present to help out the emotional moments its the tracks they put in that are my favorite to tap my toes to grus gang has plenty of decade classics and other songs that need to fill the void are brought out by the minions cover giving you that comedic edge to the filmthe animationdesign now we get into the levels that are the main strengths for me in this film illumination may not be groundbreaking in terms of animation and design but they certainly did accomplish fluid movement and that loveable kid friendly structure that we fell in love with years ago grus adventures are still whacky and the extreme features they share are still all utilized well to make that caricature design love but helping incorporate some other cultural moves into the works as well the martial arts montage shows how they keep putting new features into the design and again it works so well to make this adventure enjoyablethe balance somewhat minions 2 had a lot of things to juggle and three plot lines to leap about to make the adventure whole it worked for the most part at least for two of the stories that they were working on youll get plenty of screen time between the classic three and grus adventure as they each work to the ultimate goal of being the ultimate villain of the era the gimmicks are cute and each story has its own feel to it that are grossly different but yet connect like an ionic bond to make something stronger the other plot line is attempting to incorporate a new character and while a little heartwarming is primarily comedic antics that will end up in some way shape and form in the form of a toy nevertheless many of these plot lines do well to get adequate time and that kept things dynamic and funthe comedy laughed a lot in this film the balance of adult humor and kid humor tickling my funny bones a lot as they vied to find their place in the writing rise of gru may not be quite as clever or cultured as the despicable me movie from long ago but it still has plenty of pizazz and welltimed moments to get you busting out a hardy chuckle or guffaw slapstick comedy physical humor pronunciation of words and some clever lines all have a nice mix into the run time always keeping the atmosphere and energy of the film in checkthe fun overall though had a lot of fun in this film and managed to find it better than several of the other entries in this film grus childhood had a lot of quirks to it but overall there was a lot of heart and adventurous energy that just made going to the movies fun another group in my showing seemed to agree and all the comedic moments and minion squeaks should fill your theater with laughter and delight not too many politics not getting lost in some cultural relevance that films seem to want to explore and its not going too deep or surreal to complicate matters this film is just another enjoyable venture that helps you take a break from the harsh reality of todaydislikespredictable plot the trailers have a lot to do with this but the movie to no surprise is a predictable mess that is a bit boring know should not have expected something like that but disney has proven to pull that twist on us when it counts to shock us to the core minions rise of gru could have tried to add a few more kinks into the mix which might have helped add that little bit of adventure that the first one did long agomore balance needed in characters you know me and my utilizing characters well if you are going to include them rise of gru does an okay job on about a handful of characters but cant help but feel there were too many new contenders to the mix to say they were all crucial to the plot the main antagonists were unimpressive and certainly could have been paired or sent out on other missions to help give them more dimension than the stereotypes they served as meanwhile brand and andrews characters were very scarce maximizing their time but really not having a leg in the race like had hoped they would and even the new minion did not quite shine like the original trio meaning he was pretty much for toys than running with his boys which again was a shamecould have used a little more heartwarming moments the first two movies had those touching moments that really dug into your hearts and pulled the family card out for you to enjoy however minions 2 while trying did not quite have the same awwwww moments you might be looking for dont get me wrong there are still cute moments to be had some as trades to get the joke in and there are those hints of something deeper happening yet this films balance towards the character side did not quite come off as clean as the previous installmentssort of disconnected at times finally the movie feels not quite as linear and connected as the other films have had in the past whether it was due to delays or the fear of too much story this sequelprequel has moments that feel like something was dropped or edited down to get to the end game faster while it is subtle at times there is just something missing that feels like a directors cut is needed for home releasethe verdict the claims of the movie being the funniest of the year is at least partially true minions rise of gru is by far the same spectacle you have come to expect with bright animation lots of music references that are great for guys like me and great voice acting that makes them come to life sure it has some predictability issues and character inclusionbalance is not perfect leading to a disconnected feeling that the first two movies did better yet the movie is still super fun and accomplishes the task of not being political and just being a movie to lose yourself in for a few hours when all of this is said and done the movie for me gets a thumbs up for theater watching if you can and with that my scores areanimationadventurecomedy 80 movie overall 70
17,nothing too impressive or new te scenes look contrived learning kungfu scenes were an utter waste of time too slapstick even for kids hope there will be a better storyline next time
18,was pretty excited about this one after seeing the trailer but it was just disappointing me and my kids went and also to the original minions 1 movie and it was just ok they had fun but their standards for movies is pretty lowit looked great but the story and characters just felt so boring and flat jokes were just ok mostly flat here as well just felt a bit all over the place and didnt click for us they could have done so much better with this movie just disappointing
19,take this for what it is am a late 40s guy watching this and that is my fault however this is set in 1976 so remember a tiny bit of it anachronisms a plenty but that said this the return of some little yellow pilled gibberish spewingthings did watch despicable me years ago but cant fully remember what that was about this one is gru attempting to join a super villain coalition this coming during the chinese new year a jade amulet holds the answer to his entry into the world of villainy so he desperately wants to be accepted by his fellow baddies cool cameo voices by jean claude van damme julie andrews and dolph lundgren however through so much audio processing they may as well be anyonethis is so mediocre tired tropes of minions rambling a language between portuguese and french hard to say but a few cute moments dont save a movie that seems sotemplate builtthe noise and butt jokes will be amusing for the kids the 70s references will placate the gen xers
20,ive been waiting since despicable me 2 for the makers of the minions to make another good movie in the franchise after seeing minions the rise of gru think ill have to keep waiting this movie isnt as trashy and terrible as the last 2 movies with minions but its not anything special always have a slight issue with any of these movies because having an aspiring villain as your protagonist is such a challenge its hard for me to cheer for a young gru to become more evil and im not even sure how the logic of the villains even works it seems like the minute gru gets the better of the vicious 6 they would consider him a great villain yet they instead form this vendetta against him it just never works for me living in these opposite worlds where bad is good and good is bad particularly with such loveable and funloving minions theres a lack of any consistency and even if get a chuckle out of it dont think its the best kind of storytellingstill think that the minions are better in smaller doses the long sequences with just minions and them learning kung fu is only cute for a few minutes and starts to get tedious as they go on also struggle every single time watch a prequel dont understand hollywoods fascination with making them and just like any other prequel they make a point of shining a spotlight on things that are in the original movies oh look its dr nefario now there is that bank manager guy know him its not good storytelling and fails to have a purpose for people who arent overly familiar with the first film there is a lot of negativity in this review but want to make it clear didnt hate seeing this movie minions the rise of gru was good for some laughs particularly in the big climax dont hate the minions as much as some other people do and wanted to enjoy this as much as liked despicable me or even despicable me 2 it was underwhelming but considering where the franchise has gone this was at least a little more enjoyable
21,after the last of the minions movies despicable me 3 thought the adorable critters had stayed too long at the party the sequel dropoff had been trending reaching low enough for a mercy killing so when saw that there was another round coming  a prequel of grus origin story entered the theater with trepidation surprise this one may be the funniest of the series new writers apparently did the trick well matthew fogel is new to the franchise and brian lynch is returning after penning the relatively amusing minions in 2015 they give us gru at age 11 aspiring to be a supervillain and already variably helped and plagued by his little yellow pals he gets the chance to join a quintet of his megavillain heroes when the vacancy theyd just created by ousting the sixth member opens the selection for his replacement they shun him just because hes a kid inspiring him to turn the tables on them to prove his worth the plot borrows from the indiana jones legacy and slips in homages to kung fu flicks and many other popculture figures and themes set in1976 mostly in san franciscothe more of those movies youve seen  live action or animated  the more youll find to enjoy here for example one of the evildoers has a huge crablike right arm not only is he named jeanclawed but mr van damme actually provides his voice steve carrell returns as gru assisted by the likes of michelle yeoh lucy liu alan arkin danny trejo and juliefreakin  andrews thats establishing a cast pedigree that the script serves dutifullybesides the job they did of packing lots of laughs into the dialog and rapidfire action there are goodies to savor in the backgrounds ala the simpsons art design is firstrate with a wealth of colors and characters to tickle viewers of all ages no animation corps ever used san francisco to better advantage making the city and bay area look gorgeous  especially chinatown this is one of those rare films worth seeing twice since so much is going on so quickly that im sure missed a number of gags dont just drop the kids at the theater for this one join them
22,was always impressed with the previous minions movies by the depth and intelligence of some of the references and jokesthis one just doesnt seem that clever  the minions are adorable as always but many of the same old gags are recycled  they slap each other they laugh at farts they get covered in muck got itone challenge is that gru is portrayed throughout as a kid  in previous movies think grus weariness at the adult world and its challenges added a layer that is missing herewas amused to reread the credits  some pretty heavyduty voice actors here many of whom get one line will arnett steve coogan russell brand is promoted prominently and has maybe five lines in the whole filmthe kids will love it and there are worse ways to spend an afternoon but it just didnt ring for meps  am intrigued in the worst possible way by some of the reviews here  at least a dozen proclaiming it the best film of all time a lifechanger it saved my marriage stupid internet troll joke or the pr department at the studio trying to boost the average review score hmm
